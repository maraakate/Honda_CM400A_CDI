If you need too fix your old cb400a cdi....heres what worked for
mine
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-------
The haredest thing about this repair is totally removing metal cdi
housing.

Too do this...have a metal worker grind all for corners then peel
and bend
housing off....then throw away. you make a plastic one later.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Once removed you need too soak the whole cdi but not elec
wire harness-into the strongest jelly type paint stripper from
walmart ($6).
Let soak in small metal can and cover with tin foil maybe a few
hours
until you melt off enough crap to start too see a green or yellow
capacitor.
(THIS CAN SHOCK YOU-dont touch with out insulated tools). If you
can,
see if there are written readable numbers on this part.
If there is, write them down. If those numbers say 2.2uf good.
If they say 1 or 1.5uf, you'll need a different capacitor then the
one I used.
I had to guess because mine said nothing. I choose 2.2uf 400v film
capacitor
because i saw an old honda cx500 twin that used 2.2uf.
Return unit too paint stripper for up to 3 days.
This should melt all compounds off exposing a clean circuit board.
Wash with garden hose pressure spray , then let dry completely.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
------
IF ANY ONE FINDS OUT WHICH CAPACITOR WAS USED ORIGINALLY,PLEASE LET
ME KNOW
1UF 1.5UF 2UF OR 2.2UF AND WHAT VOLTAGE RATING?
EMAIL ME SJSARTWORK@...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
------
Now remove old capacitor(shaped like 2 aaa batteries side by side).
SNIP THE LEADS CONNECTED TO THE CAPACITOR AS CLOSE TO THE CAPACITOR
AS
POSSIBLE. You'll need too rough these 2 prongs up with sandpaper so
you
can solder to them the new capacitor. It doesnt matter which end you
solder
on where.It's non polarized.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
--------
Next remove old 5p4m scr chip. Should be a rectangle green chip
encased in
a clear plastic housing. Its about the size of a dime. Clip the
chip out
with snippers, leaving the 3 prongs in place. NOTE WHICH DIRECTION
THE CHIP
IS IN PLACE SO YOU CAN SOLDER THE NEW ONE IN THE SAME. Too remove
the prongs
, heat up the prongs with solder iron. While hot ,pull one out at a
time
with pliers. If you know how to desolder stuff , thats is obviously
the
correct thing to do here. Once the prongs are out just stick the tip
of your
solder iron in or on each prong hole and heat up a-lot then remove
iron
quickly. That should clear the little holes.....
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-----
Next position the new chip in like the last one and solder in place.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
------
Look at your circuit board and wire connections. If you see any
cracks in
the solders or circuit paths,resolder up those cracks. Clean any
corrosion
that looks obvious. YOUR ALMOST DONE!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
------
Its time too test the unit...
First wrap circuit board completely in electric tape. Doesnt need
too be
tight,you'll remove that later. It's just to prevent shocks to you...
Plug everything into bike as it should. Start and run bike. It
should run
like a charm. If so, remove it from bike and BE CAREFUL...THE
CAPACITOR IS
NOW CHARGED!!! Too remove charge...pull off tape and use insulated
screwdriver to ground the 2 capacitor leads together a few times.
If you dont want to do this, just be careful to not touch any part
of the
actual circuit board or capacitor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Lastly you need too make or find a durable plastic housing about
the
original size. You should fill half the container with a non
conductive
silicon or potting compound. Settle cdi into this, then fill the
other side
of plastic container so the cdi should be totally encased in this
silicon.
You might need too let dry for up to a week(the rubber helps
protect from
(weather,vibration,and heat). Just be patient, cause you'll have a
working
cdi for real cheap and will have saved possible hundreds. Also youll
have
the gratified feeling of do it youself cdi fix...

good luck
god bless
and be careful
